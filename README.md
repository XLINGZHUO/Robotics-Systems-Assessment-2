PID control is considered to be a basic control method, and for mobile robots, discrete-time PID control is often used, but its coordination can be extremely time-consuming. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic tuning method that applies a fuzzy PID logic, and tests it on a pre-designed track with a line following challenge. It is shown experimentally that the fuzzy logic method proposed in this paper demonstrates the best level of smoothness and overall completion level, with the smallest mean values in terms of total distance travelled and total time.
